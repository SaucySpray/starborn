# StarBorn
Experience interactive birth and death of a star.

### Built With
- HTML5
- JavaScript - Canvas
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

![JavaScript](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-128/javascript-1-225993.png) **+** ![SASS](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-128/sass-226054.png)

### Installing

A online demo is available : **[StarBorn](http://www.achabe.com/starborn/)**

I recommend using a emulated server (MAMP will do the work) if you decide to edit or fork this project locally.
You can also use **serve** command to emulate your server quickly : `npm install -g serve`.

Also, you'll need a **[SASS compiler](http://koala-app.com/)** to edit scss files.

### How it works ?

This javascript canvas page use class structure.
I call **Star.js** with **Animation.js** to create each elements you'll see on canvas.
The interractions & DOM elements are stocked in **Canvas.js**
And the **index.js** import **Animation.js** and start rendering our app.

This could be improved with WebGL for betters effects and immersive 3D environement implementation.

Have fun modifying it :+1:
